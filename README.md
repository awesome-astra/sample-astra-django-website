# Sample Django app with Astra DB

This is a simple Django application to illustrate how to use Astra DB
as database backend. The code is ready to run (provided you first go
through the setup step), but for your convenience we also provide a list
of what should be changed on an existing application to migrate it
to Astra DB.

The application uses the
[`django-cassandra-engine`](http://r4fek.github.io/django-cassandra-engine/)
package and shows how to use the models it
provides, but also how to access and directly work with the underlying
session object for more advanced, Cassandra-specific usages.
